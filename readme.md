<h1 align="center">Chicken Spiral Algorithm<project-name></h1>

<p align="center">This is an algorithm implementation of a Chicken that walks in spiral.<project-description></p>

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Built With
  
- C++
- CMAKE
  
## üìñ Explication

The algorithm simulates the creation of a Chicken and HenHouse (2d Matrix), we will set the initial position and the total steps of the chicken,
next the chicken will "walk" in the HenHouse in spiral way based on the total steps and its initial position. 

Example:

Chicken with start position (5,5), 31 total steps and start facing north. 
HenHouse with size(25,25).
